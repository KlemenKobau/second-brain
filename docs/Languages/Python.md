## Async

- Async code in python is still blocking

Running the following code in the REPL will return control back to the user after 10 seconds
```py
import asyncio

async def main():
    print('Hello ...')
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    print('... World!')

asyncio.run(main())
```

This prints:
```
Hello ...
<Wait 10 seconds>
... World!
<Control is returned back to the user>
```

One way of doing async tasks is with:

```py
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

asyncio.ensure_future(main(), loop=loop)
asyncio.ensure_future(main(), loop=loop)

loop.run_forever()
```

This blocks the main thread, but the result will be as follows

```
Hello ...
Hello ...
<Wait 10 seconds>
... World!
... World!
<Control is not returned!>
```
